* **Due data: 11:59pm, 11/5/2020**
* TA: Seonghyun Park (shpark95@snu.ac.kr)

## Goals

## B-tree

### Brief history

In the class, you learned Binary Search Trees (BSTs). In theory, the time-
complexity is close to optimal, but in reality they are not that good. Why?

The underpinning of such suboptimal performance of BSTs is related to
the _memory hierarchy_. To be more specific, not all memory locations
are accessed equally fast. Some are accessed fast (_fast_ memory,
e.g., a CPU cache), while the others are accessed slow (_slow_ memory,
e.g., DRAM). In BST, every time you visit the node, you perform the
comparison operation. Based on the comparison result, you visit the
next node, either the left or the right node, which involves to fetch
the next node from _slow_ memory. This memory access per every node
visit may severely downgrade the performance. 

However, in the B-tree, you will be able to load many keys at once
from _slow_ memory, and perform multiple comparisons while the keys
are loaded in the _fast_ memory. Thus, compared to BST, B-tree does
not need to access _slow_ memory per comparison/visit, because
multiple comparison/visit operations can be performed with a single
_slow_ memory access (followed by multiple _fast_ memory
accesses). The detailed memory hierarchy mechanism is beyond the scope
of this course, and you will learn more in the computer architecture
class!

### Definitions

So what defines a B-tree? B-tree has a special parameter `B`, which determines
the minimum/maximum number of keys that can be held per node. In particular,
given `B`, a node should hold `B-1` to `2*B-1` keys and `K+1` children, where
`K` is the number of keys in that node. One exception is that the root node is allowed
to have smaller number of keys (even a single key is okay).  Note that the
nodes in a B-tree are _perfectly_ balanced, 
which means that the path to every leaf node has
the same length.

## Types

We will take a look at the types:

``` c++
enum class NodeType { LEAF, INTERNAL };

template<typename T, size_t B = 6>
struct BTreeNode;

template<typename T, size_t B = 6>
struct BTree {
    BTreeNode<T, B>* root = nullptr;

    ~BTree() { if (root) delete root; }

    bool insert(const T&);
    bool remove(const T&);
};

template<typename T, size_t B>
struct BTreeNode {
    NodeType type;
    size_t n;
    std::array<T, 2 * B - 1> keys;
    std::array<BTreeNode *, 2 * B> edges;

    BTreeNode();
    BTreeNode(const T& t);

    bool insert(const T& t);
    size_t get_index(const T& t);

    static std::pair<BTreeNode*, size_t> search(BTreeNode<T, B>*, const T& t);
    static void split_child(BTreeNode<T, B>&, size_t);
};
```

A `BTree` has a pointer to a `BTreeNode`. A `BTreeNode` has two
arrays, `keys` and `edges` (holding references to children
nodes). Note that a node does not have a pointer to its parent
node. In fact, they don't have to. An example B-tree, where B=2 looks
like:

```
root: ------+
            |
            v
            [   4    |    7    |    11    ]
           /         |         |           \
          v          v         v            v
[ 1 | 2 | 3 ]    [ 5 | 6 ]   [ 10 ]    [ 13 | 14 | 16 ]
```

In this example, the root node has three keys (i.e., K=3) and 4
children. There are four leaf nodes, where each leaf node has a
different number of keys---from 1 to 3. All the leaf nodes have the
same depth, meaning that the tree is perfectly balanced.

## Insertion

The strategy for insertion is simple. Insert at the root. If a node that you
encounter on the way to the leaf is full ? (i.e., `2*B-1` keys) Then split.

### Inserting a partially full leaf node (`K < 2*B-1`)

If a leaf node that you end up is partially full, then you are
lucky. Just insert the key to a proper position (Note that keys in a
node should be sorted). You can implament and use `get_index()`
function to find the right position in a node, with a given
key. For example:

```
n: --> [ 14 | 25 | 31 | 43 ]
       0    1    2    3

get_index(n, 27) --> 2
get_index(n, 11) --> 0
get_index(n, 45) --> 3
```

### Inserting a full leaf node (`K == 2*B-1`)

If a leaf node is full, there is no room for new item, therefore you should find
a room for a new node. How? By splitting a node. This is possible only if a
direct parent to that node is partially full.

```
            [   4    |    7    ]
           /         |          \
          v          v           v
[ 1 | 2 | 3 ]    [ 5 | 6 ]   [ 13 | 14 | 18 ]*

```

If we are inserting 16 to this B-tree, it will end up in the `*` node, which is
a full leaf node. To make a room for this node, we split this tree by pulling up the
middle item to the parent:

```
            [   4    |    7    |    14    ]
           /         |         |           \
          v          v         v            v
[ 1 | 2 | 3 ]    [ 5 | 6 ]   [ 13 ]       [ 18 ]*

```

Finally, you can insert 16 to the node `*`.

```
            [   4    |    7    |    14    ]
           /         |         |           \
          v          v         v            v
[ 1 | 2 | 3 ]    [ 5 | 6 ]   [ 13 ]    [ 16 | 18 ]

```

### Ensuring the nodes are not full

In order to split a child node, the parent should never be full. Otherwise there
will be no room for a pulled-up key. Thus, on your search path, if a node is full,
you should split it before advancing to next level.

Here are the list of functions that are relevant to insertion. You only need to
fill in the following functions to pass the insertion test. (Note that
implementing deletion is optional)

* `BTreeNode::insert`
* `BTreeNode::get_index`
* `BTreeNode::split_child`

### (Optional) B-Tree Deletion

As an optional assignment, you will implement the deletion function.
This will be quite challenging to implement, so you will get extra
credits if you succeed. 

The relevant functions are:

* `BTreeNode::remove`
* `BTreeNode::try_borrow_from_sibling` (optional)
* `BTreeNode::borrow_from_right`
* `BTreeNode::borrow_from_left`
* `BTreeNode::merge_children`

A sketch of deletion algorithm will be provided during the lab session.

## WARNING: The keys and the edges should always start from 0. Don't leave empty spaces in the beginning of the keys or edges!

## Submission and Grading

### Testing your own programs

In `03-btree` directory, you run the following commands to compile your own
implementation.

```
$ pwd
/xxx/xxx/xxx/03-btree
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
$ ls tests/btree_test
./test/btree_test
$ ./tests/btree_test

```

If you've all done correctly, the output will look like:


```
===============================================================================
All tests passed (XX assertions in XX test cases)

```

and you are ready to submit!

### (Optional) Testing deletion

```
$ ./tests/btree_delete_test
[...]
```

If you've all done correctly, the output will look like:
